# ARK Survival Ascended Docker Server ü¶ï

This image provides a ARK Survival Ascended server. After the first start it downloads the necessary files from the Steam servers. If there is an update to the server files, simply recreate the container without having to re-download/re-build the image. It will download everything again (just in new) and you can continue.

## Deploymentüë©‚Äçüíª

How to install this Docker Container

1. Install Docker on your Server. Here you can find a guide [[here]](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=How+to+install+Docker+on+Ubuntu)

Notice: Due to the fact that I can only upload Docker container images of up to 500MB on GitHub without paying anything and the image is 3.4GB in total, you will have to build the image yourself based on my files. It's not hard and explained below.

2. Run this command. This will retrieve the required files from the GitHub repository and create the image. (with Docker already installed)
```bash
docker build https://github.com/Auhrus/Dockerized-ARKSurvivalAscended-Server.git#main -t ghcr.io/auhrus/ark-ascended-server:latest
```
3. After the process is complete, run this command.
```bash
docker run --name CONAINER_NAME -p 8888:8888/udp -p 27015:27015/udp -v VOLUME_NAME:/home/steam/Steam/steamapps/common/ARK Survival Ascended Dedicated Server/ShooterGame/Saved ghcr.io/auhrus/ark-ascended-server:latest
```
Please replace all things written in CAPS.

3. After all data has been downloaded, the server will start and generates the save files etc.


## IMPORTANT‚ÄºÔ∏è
-Make sure that the folder of the volumes for the configs and the saves have the owner and group 1000:1000.
